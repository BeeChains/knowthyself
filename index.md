# "I" As The Center Of Gravity Is The Seat Of Unity. 

This life is the subjective adventure of that mysterious entity called ‘I’. -- The Eye Of The I by David R. Hawkins M.D.,Ph.D

Spiritual 'I', ego 'i'
Q: Who Am I?
A: It is I, I Am, The Inner 'I'

'I' denotes Being Self-Aware, Self-Knowing

Is 'I' first thought of by ITSELF, as Being THE ONE who and whom can witness and transcend thought?

Is 'I' seen as the first thought formed within SELF and of SUPREME MIND ITSELF, as Living Root of the Tree of Knowledge?

Is 'I' Root Access for the Self-Aware to Know Thyself via the mind's eye or say the mind's I?

Is 'I' the root of i-magi-nation, and all other imaginings, concepts and ideas?

Is 'I' the Spirit embedded Within by SOURCE?

Is 'I' Knowing Awareness, the Knower of the Knowledge that is Known Itself?

Is 'I', Self-Aware inner Sovereign Knowing Intelligence Presence beyond and Within all form or concept of Knowledge?
Is 'I', Self-Knowing Presence?

Is 'I, I AM' the beginning and end of duality? A Direct Path, Absolute Unity Consciousness?
Is 'I' at the root of your i-magi-nation? Who else could be?
